## 🎓 Interview-Ready Explanation

**Q: How does SD-Turbo achieve such fast inference?**

**A**: SD-Turbo uses **Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD)**, a novel technique that:

1. **Distills knowledge** from the full SDXL model into a faster student model
2. **Combines two training objectives**:
   - Score distillation: Matches the diffusion process of the teacher
   - Adversarial training: Uses a discriminator to ensure output quality
3. **Operates in latent space** (not pixel space), reducing computational cost
4. **Eliminates classifier-free guidance**, cutting inference time in half

The result: A model that generates high-quality images in **1-4 steps** instead of 20-50, with minimal quality degradation.

**Q: What are the tradeoffs?**

**A**: 
- **Pros**: 10-50x faster, same VRAM, maintains quality, open-source
- **Cons**: Less control (no guidance scale), slightly less detail than full SDXL, works best at 512×512

**Q: When would you use SD-Turbo vs SDXL?**

**A**:
- **SD-Turbo**: Real-time apps, interactive tools, rapid prototyping, resource-constrained environments
- **SDXL**: Highest quality needed, fine-grained control, artistic applications, larger images

## 📖 Technical Deep Dive

### Latent Diffusion Process

1. **Forward Process (Training)**: Gradually add noise to images
2. **Reverse Process (Inference)**: Remove noise in latent space
3. **SD-Turbo Innovation**: Jump large steps using distilled knowledge

### Why FP16 Works Well

- Image generation is **noise-tolerant**
- Small precision errors don't compound visibly
- Latent space is **low-dimensional** (4×64×64 for 512×512 image)
- Modern GPUs have **specialized FP16 hardware** (Tensor Cores)
